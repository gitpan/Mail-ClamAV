Mail::ClamAV Installation
=========================

First you will need to install libclamav. You can find links to download
libclamav at: http://www.clamav.net/

You will need atleast clamav-0.70-rc.

You will also need Inline::C which depends on Parse::RecDescent. You can use
CPAN to install both like this:
    perl -MCPAN -e 'install("Inline::C")'

If you have libclamav installed into a non-standard path you will need to
specify the path to Makefile.PL. You can do that like this:
    perl Makefile.PL LIBS=-I/path/to/headers INC=-L/path/to/libs

The path specified by -I must contain clamav.h, and the path specified by -L
must contain libclamav.so.

The next steps are simple:
    make
    make test
    make install

That should do it. If you have any troubles feel free to email me

Enjoy!
