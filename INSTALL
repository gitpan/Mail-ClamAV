Mail::ClamAV Installation
=========================

First you will need to install libclamav. You can find links to download
libclamav at: http://www.clamav.net/

This module has been tested with clamav-0.60 and clamav-0.65 releases. I can
not say for sure if it will work with other versions but chances are it will.

If you have libclamav installed into a non-standard path you will need to
specify the path to Makefile.PL. You can do that like this:

    LIBS='-I/path/to/headers -L/path/to/libs' perl Makefile.PL

The path specified by -I must contain clamav.h, and the path specified by -L
must contain libclamav.so.

The next steps are simple:

    make
    make test
    make install

That should do it. If you have any troubles feel free to email me

Enjoy!
