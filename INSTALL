Mail::ClamAV Installation
=========================

First you will need to install libclamav. You can find links to download
libclamav at: http://www.clamav.net/

This version of Mail::ClamAV requires >=0.80 to work. It has only been tested
with 0.80 but should work with future versions baring any more API changes.

You will also need Inline::C which depends on Parse::RecDescent. You can use
CPAN to install both like this:
    perl -MCPAN -e 'install("Inline::C")'

The next steps are simple:
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

That should do it. If you have any troubles feel free to email me

Enjoy!
